I am an aspiring quantum computing researcher actively seeking Ph.D. positions.
I am also seeking research positions with industry or academic groups for the time until my graduate studies begin (planned fall '19).

My past research experience is in quantum computational complexity and in quantum tomography. I am interested in working more with applications of quantum computing and with related topics like algorithms and optimization while still continuing to develop on my previous theory experience.

I graduated in May 2018 with a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Mathematics from Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, VA. I was fully funded by a VCU Presidential Scholarship.

During my undergrad, I worked as a research assistant at VCU under Dr. Sevag Gharibian, studying quantum computational complexity. I also worked as an undergrad at the University of Maryland (UMD) QuICS under Dr. Andrew Childs, studying quantum tomography. In summer 2018, I worked as a research assistant in the Graph Theory Computational Discovery Lab at VCU.

To date, I have had work from 4 different projects presented at conferences, 3 of which studied quantum computing.

Please see [my CV](./CV_JYirka.pdf) for details on my past research experience, education, and more.
