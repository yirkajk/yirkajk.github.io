### News:
  * 10 August: My summer position with the Graph Theory Computational Discovery Lab at VCU has ended. I'll now be working on my AQIS 2018 presentation, applying for graduate school, and on more quantum computing research.
  * 25 July: I will be giving a talk in September at the Asian Conference on Quantum Information Science (AQIS 2018) in Nagoya, Japan on recent work with Sevag Gharibian and Stephen Piddock entitled *Oracle complexity classes and local measurements on physical Hamiltonians* (preprint available soon).
  * 17 July: Recent paper *Quantum generalizations of the polynomial hierarchy with applications to QMA(2)* with coauthors Sevag Gharibian, Miklos Santha, Jamie Sikora, and Aarthi Sundaram has been accepted for a **long / plenary** talk at the Asian Conference on Quantum Information Science (AQIS 2018) in Nagoya, Japan in September. Preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11139
  * 12 June: Recent paper *Quantum generalizations of the polynomial hierarchy with applications to QMA(2)* with coauthors Sevag Gharibian, Miklos Santha, Jamie Sikora, and Aarthi Sundaram has been accepted for a talk at the International Symposium on Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science (MFCS 2018) in Liverpool in August.

I am an aspiring quantum computing researcher actively seeking Ph.D. positions.
I am also seeking research positions with industry or academic groups for the time until my graduate studies begin (planned fall '19).

I graduated in May 2018 with a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Math from Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, VA.
During my undergrad, I worked as a research assistant at VCU under Dr. Sevag Gharibian as well as at the University of Maryland (UMD) QuICS under Dr. Andrew Childs.

My past research experience is in quantum computational complexity and in tomography.
I am interested in working more with applications of quantum computing and with related topics like algorithms and optimization while still continuing to develop on my previous theory experience.

In summer 2018, I worked as a research assistant in the Graph Theory Computational Discovery Lab at VCU.
In fall 2018, I am presenting my work at AQIS 2018 in Japan, applying to graduate programs, continuing quantum complexity research, and learning about new fields.
