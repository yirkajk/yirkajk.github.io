I am an aspiring quantum computing researcher currently applying to Ph.D. positions.  
I'm also seeking either industry or academic positions for spring and summer of 2019.

#### Research Interests
My interests are in quantum computing, including computational complexity theory, algorithms, and connections to applications.  
My past experience is primarily with complexity theory.  
I'm open to learning about a variety of topics, such as algorithms, cryptography, optimization, or verification of near-term devices. I hope to find some inspiration/guidance to refine my research interests as I pursue a Ph.D.

#### Research Experience
  - **Visiting Researcher**  
  University of Paderborn, Germany  
  (3 weeks) November 2018  
  Collaboration with Sevag Gharibian, Ph.D.  
  Topic: Complexity theory and algorithms. Worked to show QMA_1-hardness of the quantum satisfaction problem (k-QSAT) given qudits of lower dimensions (i.e. improving on current necessary dimensions).
  - **Research Assistant**  
  Graph Theory Computational Discovery Lab, VCU  
  Summer 2018  
  Supervisor: Craig Larson, Ph.D.  
  Topic: Automated conjecturing and graph Hamiltonicity. *Sage*, *Python*, and *GitHub*. Implemented algorithms for graph properties, improved open-source project structure, and tested graph conjectures.
  - **NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates / Undergraduate Researcher**  
  Joint Center for Quantum Information and Computer Science (QuICS), University of Maryland  
  Summer 2017  
  Supervisor: Andrew Childs, Ph.D.  
  Topic: Quantum tomography. Investigated minimum number of Pauli observables necessary to identify a pure state. Attempted to apply numerical results, group theory (i.e. Clifford group), and hypergraph theory.
  - **Undergraduate Research Assistant**  
  Quantum Computing Lab, VCU  
  2015 - 2016  
  Supervisor: Sevag Gharibian, Ph.D.  
  Topic: Quantum computational complexity. Studied quantum oracle classes (e.g. P^QMA[log]) characterized by local physical problems and helped develop "quantum PH" and “quantum Toda’s Theorem” (QCPH ⊆ P^PP^PP).
