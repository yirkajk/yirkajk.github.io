#### Research Interests
Quantum computing: what can quantum computers do, what can't they do, and the structure that creates those differences.  

Specific areas I'm interested in include quantum computational complexity, algorithms, and connections to applications.

#### Research Experience
  - **Summer school / Research Assistant**  
  Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Quantum Computing Summer School  
  Summer 2019  
  Supervisor: Yigit Subasi, Ph.D.  
  Topic: Near-term (NISQ) quantum algorithms. Studied use of qubit resets to construct circuits for entanglement spectroscopy which were noise-resilient *and* low-width.    
  - **Visiting Researcher**  
  University of Paderborn, Germany  
  (3 weeks) November 2018  
  Collaboration with Sevag Gharibian, Ph.D.  
  Topic: Complexity theory and algorithms. Studied QMA_1-hardness of the quantum satisfaction problem (k-QSAT) given qudits of lower dimensions (i.e. improving on current necessary dimension).
  - **Research Assistant**  
  Graph Theory Computational Discovery Lab, VCU  
  Summer 2018  
  Supervisor: Craig Larson, Ph.D.  
  Topic: Automated conjecturing and graph theory. Studied conditions for graph Hamiltonicity. Assisted with programming and open-source project management.
  - **NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates / Undergraduate Researcher**  
  Joint Center for Quantum Information and Computer Science (QuICS), University of Maryland  
  Summer 2017  
  Supervisor: Andrew Childs, Ph.D.  
  Topic: Quantum tomography. Investigated minimum number of Pauli observables necessary to identify a quantum pure state.
  - **Undergraduate Research Assistant**  
  Quantum Computing Lab, VCU  
  2015 - 2016  
  Supervisor: Sevag Gharibian, Ph.D.  
  Topic: Quantum computational complexity. Studied quantum oracle classes (e.g. P^QMA[log]) and complexity of local physical problems. Helped develop a "quantum PH" and “quantum Toda’s Theorem” (QCPH ⊆ P^PP^PP).
