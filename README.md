I am an aspiring quantum computing researcher.

#### Research Interests
Quantum computing: what can quantum computers do, what can't they do, and the structure that creates those differences.

Specific areas I'm interested in include quantum computational complexity, algorithms, optimization, and connections to applications.  

While my interests are mostly theoretical, I also find motivation in efforts to develop and apply quantum computers.

#### Research Experience
  - **Visiting Researcher**  
  University of Paderborn, Germany  
  (3 weeks) November 2018  
  Collaboration with Sevag Gharibian, Ph.D.  
  Topic: Complexity theory and algorithms. Worked to show QMA_1-hardness of the quantum satisfaction problem (k-QSAT) given qudits of lower dimensions (i.e. improving on current necessary dimensions).
  - **Research Assistant**  
  Graph Theory Computational Discovery Lab, VCU  
  Summer 2018  
  Supervisor: Craig Larson, Ph.D.  
  Topic: Automated conjecturing and graph Hamiltonicity. *Sage*, *Python*, and *GitHub*. Implemented algorithms for graph properties, improved open-source project structure, and tested graph conjectures.
  - **NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates / Undergraduate Researcher**  
  Joint Center for Quantum Information and Computer Science (QuICS), University of Maryland  
  Summer 2017  
  Supervisor: Andrew Childs, Ph.D.  
  Topic: Quantum tomography. Investigated minimum number of Pauli observables necessary to identify a pure state. Attempted to apply numerical results, group theory (i.e. Clifford group), and hypergraph theory.
  - **Undergraduate Research Assistant**  
  Quantum Computing Lab, VCU  
  2015 - 2016  
  Supervisor: Sevag Gharibian, Ph.D.  
  Topic: Quantum computational complexity. Studied quantum oracle classes (e.g. P^QMA[log]) characterized by local physical problems and helped develop "quantum PH" and “quantum Toda’s Theorem” (QCPH ⊆ P^PP^PP).
