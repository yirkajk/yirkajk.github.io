I am an aspiring quantum computing researcher, **actively seeking Ph.D. positions related to quantum computing.  
I am also seeking research positions with industry or academic groups for the time until my graduate studies begin (planned fall '19).**

Please **see [My CV](./CV_JYirka.pdf) for full details** on my research experience, presentations, education, service, and more.

#### Research Interests
I'm interested generally in theoretical quantum computing.  
My past experience is primarily with quantum computational complexity.  
I want to continue work with complexity theory, while also learning more about how to apply theory to application-motivated problems.  
Following these interests, I would also like to work more with topics such as algorithms, cryptography, or optimization.  
I'm open to learning about a variety of research areas as I continue to refine my interests.

#### Education
I graduated in May 2018 with a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Mathematical Sciences from Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, VA.  
I was fully funded by a VCU Presidential Scholarship.

#### Research Experience
  - **Research Assistant**  
  Graph Theory Computational Discovery Lab, VCU  
  Summer 2018  
  Supervisor: Craig Larson, Ph.D.  
  Topic: Automated conjecturing and graph Hamiltonicity. Implemented algorithms for graph properties, improved open-source project structure for future use, and evaluated graph Hamiltonicity conjectures.

  - **NSF REU Undergraduate Researcher**  
  Joint Center for Quantum Information and Computer Science (QuICS), University of Maryland  
  Summer 2017  
  Supervisor: Andrew Childs, Ph.D.  
  Topic: Quantum pure-state tomography. Investigated Pauli observables using group theory (e.g. Clifford group) and bounds from study of hypergraphs.

  - **Undergraduate Research Assistant**  
  Quantum Computing Lab, VCU  
  2015 - 2016  
  Supervisor: Sevag Gharibian, Ph.D.  
  Topic: Quantum computational complexity. Studied quantum oracle classes characterized by local physical problems (e.g. P^QMA[log]) and partially developed “quantum Toda’s Theorem” (QCPH ⊆ P^PP^PP).

#### Preprints
  - Sevag Gharibian, Stephen Piddock, and **Justin Yirka**. "Oracle complexity classes and local measurements on physical Hamiltonians”. Preprint available soon.
