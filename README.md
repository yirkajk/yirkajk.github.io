I am an aspiring quantum computing researcher, **actively seeking Ph.D. positions related to quantum computing.  
I am also seeking research positions with industry or academic groups for the time until my graduate studies begin (planned fall '19).**

See [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/a/yirka_j_1.html) for a list of my currently available preprints.  
Please **see [My CV](./CV_JYirka.pdf) for full details** on my research experience, research presentations, education, service, and more.

##### Research Interests
My past research experience is with quantum computational complexity and quantum tomography.  
I am interested in working with more application-oriented areas of quantum computing like approximation algorithms and optimization, while continuing to develop on my previous theory and complexity research.

##### Education
I graduated in May 2018 with a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Mathematical Sciences from Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, VA.  
I was fully funded by a VCU Presidential Scholarship.

##### Research Experience
  - **Research Assistant**  
  Graph Theory Computational Discovery Lab, VCU  
  Summer 2018  
  Supervisor: Craig Larson, Ph.D.  
  Topic: Automated conjecturing and graph Hamiltonicity. Implemented algorithms for graph properties, improved open-source project structure for future use, and evaluated graph Hamiltonicity conjectures.

  - **NSF REU Undergraduate Researcher**  
  Joint Center for Quantum Information and Computer Science (QuICS), University of Maryland  
  Summer 2017  
  Supervisor: Andrew Childs, Ph.D.  
  Topic: Quantum pure-state tomography. Investigated Pauli observables using group theory (e.g. Clifford group) and bounds from study of hypergraphs.

  - **Undergraduate Research Assistant**  
  Quantum Computing Lab, VCU  
  2015 - 2016  
  Supervisor: Sevag Gharibian, Ph.D.  
  Topic: Quantum computational complexity. Studied quantum oracle classes characterized by local physical problems (e.g. P^QMA[log]) and partially developed “quantum Toda’s Theorem” QCPH ⊆ P^PP.

##### Preprints
  - Sevag Gharibian, Stephen Piddock, and **Justin Yirka**. "Local measurements on physical Hamiltonians and oracle complexity classes”. Preprint available soon.

  - Sevag Gharibian, Miklos Santha, Aarthi Sundaram, and **Justin Yirka**. "Quantum generalizations of the polynomial hierarchy with applications to QMA(2)”. Available at [https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11139](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11139). Apr. 2018.
